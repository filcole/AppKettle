## IoT CLoud

The Connectivity between kettle and the "cloud" seems to be provided by the "jingxuncloud".
The app establishes a connection to query.jingxuncloud.com:6001.
The traffic is AES encrypted, but jingxuncloud ships the secrets with the app and are available within the apk file.
The traffic may be captured with tcpdump 

tcpdump -s1600 -w/tmp/kettle.tcp port 6001

An example decryption implementation is implemented in the class Jingxuncloud in this repository

Example:

Message: "{"app_cmd":"101","list":["GD0-12900-892c"]}"

Response: "{"wifi_cmd":"101","list":["GD0-12900-892c"],"serverip":["52.29.217.226"]}"
